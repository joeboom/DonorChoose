EDA &amp; Recommendation on DonorChoose Kaggle problem

This repository pertains to the DonorChoose Kaggle challenge whose objective is to
identify a solution to DonorChoose's problem of creating more repeat donors.

The overall approach to the problem was to characterize repeat donors so as to be able
to identify first-time donors that are likely targets for promotional activity based on
shared characteristics. 

The repository includes:

* A jupyter notebook which includes the code that is the basis of this analysis, 
* A Tableau workbook which can be viewed on Tableau Reader (which is a free program), and;
* A slide deck summarizing the findings.
